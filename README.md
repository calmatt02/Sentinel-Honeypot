# Sentinel-Honeypot
<h1> Azure Sentinel w/ Honeypot and Map of Cyber Attacks </h1>

<h2>Breakdown</h2>
<b>This project allowed me to gain practical knowledge of the cloud computing platform and Sentinel! In this project, 
we use Azure Sentinel and link the SIEM to a virtual machine that we'll also set up. A cool thing about Sentinel:
it allows for advanced protection, you can fine tune it to your own organization's needs, and there's advanced...unprotection.
We'll be adding our own inbound rule. The only rule: allow any and all traffic to come in contact in the vm. That's right! This
virtual machine will act as a honeypot.</b>
